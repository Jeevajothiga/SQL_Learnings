### **Deleting and Updating Data in SQL**

In SQL, we often need to modify or remove data from a table. Let’s understand **DELETE** and **UPDATE** with detailed explanations, examples, and step-by-step breakdowns.

---

### **1. DELETE Statement**
The **DELETE** statement removes rows from a table. It can delete all rows or specific rows based on a condition.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### **Key Points**
- **`WHERE` clause** is optional. Without it, all rows will be deleted.
- If you omit `WHERE`, ensure you intend to remove all data.

#### **Example Table: Employees**
| EmployeeID | Name     | Department | Salary |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1          | Alice    | HR         | 50000  |
| 2          | Bob      | IT         | 60000  |
| 3          | Charlie  | HR         | 45000  |
| 4          | David    | IT         | 70000  |

---

#### **1.1 Delete Specific Rows**
Delete employees in the **HR department**.

**Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR';
```

**Resulting Table:**
| EmployeeID | Name     | Department | Salary |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 2          | Bob      | IT         | 60000  |
| 4          | David    | IT         | 70000  |

---

#### **1.2 Delete All Rows**
Remove all data from the table.

**Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees;
```

**Resulting Table:** (Empty)

---

### **2. UPDATE Statement**
The **UPDATE** statement modifies existing rows in a table. You can update specific rows or all rows.

#### **Syntax**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

#### **Key Points**
- **`WHERE` clause** is optional. Without it, all rows in the table will be updated.
- Can update multiple columns in one query.

---

#### **2.1 Update Specific Rows**
Increase the salary of employees in the **IT department** by 10%.

**Query:**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

**Updated Table:**
| EmployeeID | Name     | Department | Salary |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 2          | Bob      | IT         | 66000  |
| 4          | David    | IT         | 77000  |

---

#### **2.2 Update All Rows**
Set the department of all employees to **General**.

**Query:**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'General';
```

**Updated Table:**
| EmployeeID | Name     | Department | Salary |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 2          | Bob      | General    | 66000  |
| 4          | David    | General    | 77000  |

---

### **Comparison Between DELETE and UPDATE**

| **Feature**              | **DELETE**                              | **UPDATE**                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**               | Removes rows from the table.            | Modifies existing rows in the table. |
| **Affects Rows**          | Deletes specific or all rows.           | Updates specific or all rows.        |
| **Requires WHERE Clause** | Optional (deletes all without it).      | Optional (updates all without it).   |
| **Undo Operation**        | Cannot be undone (use transaction).     | Cannot be undone (use transaction).  |

### **Important Notes**
1. Always use a **`WHERE` clause** to avoid accidental changes or deletions.
2. **Back up data** if performing critical operations.
3. Use **transactions** (`BEGIN`, `ROLLBACK`, `COMMIT`) to ensure changes are reversible until committed.

In SQL, to delete a specific value from a row, such as deleting the "Employee ID" of Bob, you can use an `UPDATE` statement and set the value of the "Employee ID" column to `NULL` (assuming the column allows nulls).

Here’s how you can do it:

### SQL Query:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET employee_id = NULL
WHERE employee_name = 'Bob';
```

### Explanation:
- `UPDATE employees`: Specifies the table you want to update (assuming your table is named `employees`).
- `SET employee_id = NULL`: Sets the "employee_id" to `NULL` (which represents the absence of a value).
- `WHERE employee_name = 'Bob'`: Filters the row where the employee name is "Bob".

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the `employee_id` column allows `NULL` values. If not, you'll need to modify the column to allow nulls, or choose another placeholder value.
- If you want to completely remove the row (not just the specific value), you would use a `DELETE` statement, but since you're asking to delete just a specific value, the `UPDATE` query is appropriate.

FOR COLUMNS
In SQL, you can manage columns using `DELETE` and `UPDATE` operations for rows. Here's a breakdown of how to handle **columns**:

---

### **DELETE vs. UPDATE for Columns**

#### 1. **Deleting a Column**
If you want to delete an entire column from a table, you use the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

**SQL Query to Delete a Column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP COLUMN employee_id;
```

**Explanation:**
- `ALTER TABLE employees`: Specifies the table you want to modify.
- `DROP COLUMN employee_id`: Removes the "employee_id" column entirely from the table.

---

#### 2. **Updating a Column (Rename, Change Type, etc.)**
If you want to **update** or modify a column (e.g., rename it or change its data type), you use the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the appropriate operation.

**SQL Query to Rename a Column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME COLUMN employee_id TO emp_id;
```

**SQL Query to Change the Data Type of a Column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY COLUMN employee_id VARCHAR(10);
```

**Explanation:**
- `RENAME COLUMN`: Renames the column to a new name.
- `MODIFY COLUMN`: Changes the column's data type (e.g., to `VARCHAR(10)`).

---

### **Deleting and Updating Values in a Column**

If your goal is to **delete or update specific values within a column**, you use `UPDATE` with the appropriate conditions:

#### Delete a Column's Value:
To nullify or "delete" the value in a specific column for certain rows:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET employee_id = NULL
WHERE employee_name = 'Bob';
```

#### Update a Column's Value:
To update the value of a specific column:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET employee_id = 200
WHERE employee_name = 'Alice';
```
