Aliasing in SQL is primarily focused on providing temporary names for **columns** and **tables**, but there are nuances and practical use cases worth understanding. 
  Below is a complete overview of aliasing concepts:


### **1. Column Aliasing**
- Purpose: Rename a column in the result set for readability or to match specific requirements.
- **Key Points:**
  - Alias exists only for the duration of the query.
  - Commonly used to clean up output, especially for calculated fields or aggregate functions.

**Example with Aggregate Function:**
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

**Output:**
```
| department_id | employee_count |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1             | 10             |
| 2             | 5              |
```

### **2. Table Aliasing**
- Purpose: Rename a table for brevity, especially in complex queries involving joins or subqueries.
- **Key Points:**
  - Alias can simplify references to long table names.
  - Helps differentiate tables with similar column names.

**Example with Join:**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

---

### **3. Aliasing in Subqueries**
- Purpose: Rename subqueries (derived tables) to refer to their results in the main query.
- **Key Points:**
  - A subquery **must** have an alias when used as a table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT dept_summary.department_id, dept_summary.total_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_summary;
```

---

### **4. Aliasing with Functions or Expressions**
- Purpose: Assign meaningful names to computed or transformed data.
- **Key Points:**
  - Without an alias, computed columns default to the expression itself, which can be hard to read.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

### **5. Aliasing Without the `AS` Keyword**
- In many SQL dialects, you can omit the `AS` keyword.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employee_name name, salary annual_salary
  FROM employees;
  ```

---

### **6. Aliasing in Multi-level Queries**
- Aliases can cascade through multiple levels of queries.
- Useful for breaking down complex logic into understandable steps.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT avg_salaries.department_id, avg_salaries.avg_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS avg_salaries
WHERE avg_salaries.avg_salary > 50000;
```

---

### **Key Limitations:**
- Aliases cannot be used in the `WHERE` clause. Use column aliases in `HAVING` or refer to them in outer queries.
  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  HAVING employee_count > 5; -- Valid
  ```

Aliasing in SQL is used to create temporary names for tables or columns. This makes queries more readable or allows for renaming columns in the output.

Hereâ€™s how aliasing works in SQL:

1. Column Aliasing
Column aliases give a column a temporary name in the output. Use the AS keyword (optional).

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT employee_name AS Name, employee_id AS ID
FROM employees;
Result:

lua
Copy code
| Name  | ID  |
|-------|-----|
| Alice | 101 |
| Bob   | 102 |
| Charlie | 103 |
2. Table Aliasing
Table aliases provide a temporary name for a table, especially useful when joining multiple tables.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
SELECT alias.column_name
FROM table_name AS alias;
Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.employee_name, e.department
FROM employees AS e;
3. Aliasing with Joins
Table aliases make joins more concise and easier to read.

Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

Notes:
The AS keyword is optional. For example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT employee_name alias_name
FROM employees;
This works the same way.

### In Summary:
Aliasing is simple in concept but extremely powerful in practice:
1. Rename columns for clarity or requirements (`AS` optional).
2. Rename tables or subqueries for brevity and differentiation.
3. Use aliases in functions, joins, and subqueries to simplify logic and improve readability.
